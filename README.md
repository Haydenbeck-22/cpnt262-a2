##    Code 
The image array has 9 images and they all contain the required elements described in the assignment. The loop that I used is similar to the one shown in class however I added the figure element and all the external links under the images, the images themselves are also links to the unsplash page of the original image.
## Attributions
All images are from unsplash.com and linked on the webpage.
